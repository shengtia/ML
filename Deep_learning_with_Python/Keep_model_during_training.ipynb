    "Application checkpointing is a fault tolerance technique for long running processes. It is an approach where a snapshot of the state of the system is taken in case of system failure. If there is a problem, not all is lost. The checkpoint may be used directly, or used as the starting point for a new run, picking up where it left off. When training deep learning models, the checkpoint captures the weights of the model. These weights can be used to make predictions as-is, or used as the basis for ongoing training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointing is set up to save the network weights only when there is an improvement in classification accuracy on the validation dataset (monitor=’val acc’ and mode=’max’). The weights are stored in a file that includes the score in the filename\n",
